Data Version Control (DVC)
Data Versioning
We cannot use GIT for Data Versioning because:
  1. Large size (GB, or more ~TB).
  2. Slow on large files.
  3. Cost inefficient for ORG.

CSV files are stored in remote location or storage.
Feature Engineering is done on CSV files.

For a Data Scientist:
1. Data
2. Algorithm and Training Process.
  Python Scripts (Stored in GIT repo) by DS or ML Engg: for Auditing, Versioning, RBAC for control.
  GIT implemnent Versiong for above scripts.
