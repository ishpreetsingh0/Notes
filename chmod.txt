The chmod (change mode) command in Unix/Linux is used to change the permissions of files or directories. These permissions determine who can read, write, or execute the file.
🔐 Basic Permission Types:
r – Read (4)
w – Write (2)
x – Execute (1)

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Three Types of Users:
Owner (u) – the user who owns the file
Group (g) – users who are in the file's group
Others (o) – everyone else

📌 Numeric (Octal) Mode
Each permission level gets a number:
r = 4
w = 2
x = 1
  
You add them to get a total:
7 = rwx
6 = rw-
5 = r-x
4 = r--
0 = ---
  
Ex: 
>>chmod 755 filename
Breakdown:
7 (owner) = rwx
5 (group) = r-x
5 (others) = r-x

✍️ Symbolic Mode
You can also use letters and operators:
chmod u+x filename   # Add execute permission to user
chmod go-r filename  # Remove read permission from group and others
chmod u=rw filename  # Set user permissions to read and write only

🔄 Recursive Permissions
To apply permissions to all files and subdirectories:
chmod -R 755 myfolder/
