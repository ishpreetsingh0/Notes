For Example a wine prediction model having an accuracy for 85%.
For this various experiments have to be conducted with different different models.

Experiment tracking is the process of recording and managing all details of ML experiments such as:
-Model parameters (hyperparameters)
-Training data version
-Code version
-Metrics (accuracy, loss, F1-score, etc.)
-Model artifacts (saved models)
-Environment details


1. Random Forest (csv file)(on Windows) -> Model -> 67% (example)
2. Logistic regression -> Model -> 79%
3. XGBoost (on linux) -> Model -> 89%

25th Experiment -> Model -> 81%


📌 What Do We Track?
Category:	Examples
Parameters:	Learning rate, batch size, epochs
Metrics:	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, RMSE
Artifacts:	Model file (.pkl, .pt), plots
Code version:	Git commit ID
Data version:	Dataset v1, v2
Environment:	Python version, library versions
System Information: Linux, Windows
