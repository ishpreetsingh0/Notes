MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the complete Machine Learning lifecycle.
MLflow is an open-source platform that manages the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle including experiment tracking, model packaging, model registry, and deployment.
It provides experiment tracking, reproducibility, framework independence, model versioning, and easy deployment capabilities.

It helps data scientists and ML engineers to:
-Track experiments
-Package ML code
-Manage and version models
-Deploy models to different environments
Think of it like “Git + Jenkins + Docker + Model Registry” for Machine Learning.”

MLflow has 4 major components:
1️⃣ MLflow Tracking
-Logs parameters (learning rate, batch size)
-Logs metrics (accuracy, loss)
-Stores artifacts (models, plots)
-Tracks multiple experiment runs
👉 Helps compare different model runs.
2️⃣ MLflow Projects
-Packages ML code in a reusable format
-Ensures reproducibility
-Defines dependencies using Conda or Docker
3️⃣ MLflow Models
-Standard format to save models
-Supports multiple frameworks (Sklearn, PyTorch, TensorFlow)
-Easy deployment
4️⃣ MLflow Model Registry
-Central repository for models
-Version control for models
Supports stages:
-Staging
-Production
-Archived
🚀 Advantages of MLflow
✅ 1. Experiment Tracking
You can track:
-Hyperparameters
-Metrics
->Model artifacts
->Code version
->No more confusion like:
  “Which model gave 95% accuracy?”
✅ 2. Reproducibility
-Tracks environment and dependencies
-Ensures same results when re-running experiment
✅ 3. Framework Agnostic
Works with:
-Scikit-learn
-PyTorch
-TensorFlow
-XGBoost
-And many others
Not tied to a single ML framework.
✅ 4. Model Versioning
-Each model version is stored
-Can rollback to older version
-Supports approval workflow
✅ 5. Easy Deployment
-Models can be deployed to:
-Local server
-Docker
-REST API
-Cloud platforms like Azure Machine Learning
✅ 6. Open Source & Lightweight
-Free to use
-Easy setup
-Can run locally or on cloud
🏢 Industry Use Case
Imagine you train 10 models with different learning rates.
Without MLflow:
-Results stored in notebooks
-Hard to compare
-No model version control
With MLflow:
-All runs visible in UI
-Best model automatically registered
-CI/CD pipeline can promote model to production
