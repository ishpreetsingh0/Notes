Docker-Swarm
cluster of docker conatiners are managed by docker swarm.
manage application to stay up and running.
In Docker-swarm multiple docker hosts run in swarm mode, some work as master and some work as worker.
A single machine can work as master as well as worker. Master will remain the state and instruct to maintain number of replicas. 
Minimum of 3 manager nodes (has election within them to make a leader) the data remain in sync between them by raft consensus algorithm.
Number of masters are in odd numbers = (n-1)/2  n is number of nodes required.
Worker node always requires a master node, where as master can work independently. Every workers has an agent installed which tells current state to master.
Master and worker works with secure communication ie TLS (Transport Layer Security) and Certificate Authority. Worker has a token to communicate with master.
